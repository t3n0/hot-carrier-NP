# hot-carrier-NP
This utility calculates the energy distribution of hot electrons and holes in plasmonic metallic nanoparticles after illumination.
This version is legacy code, highly unoptimised and unstable.
It is written in python 2.x.
A better more efficient and user friendly version is on the making :)
